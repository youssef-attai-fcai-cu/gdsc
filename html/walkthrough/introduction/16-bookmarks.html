<h3>Dear God</h3>
<small>BILLY</small>

<p>A pencil has to be just right.</p>
<p>Never too sharp, never too dull.</p>
<p>If it's too sharp it might poke me and I'll get lead poisoning and die!</p>
<p>I saw a show about that once.</p>
<p>People dying of lead... oh, yes and going nuts.</p>
<p>
  I seem to remember Van Gogh got so much lead poisoning he cut off his ear!
</p>
<p>Ouch!</p>
<p>
  That's like out of Shakespeare... friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your
  ears! Ha!
</p>

<small>(Checking the pencil. Pokes him)</small>

<p>Ouch! Too sharp...</p>

<small>(Tosses the pencil. Starts on another)</small>

<p>
  Now let's try to be a bit dull... dullness has it's merits. You can't get
  hurt. People don't expect as much from you. You do the job, but never for too
  long.
</p>

<small> (Checks pencil. Smiles) </small>

<p>Dull it is.</p>

<small>(Sits with pad and paper)</small>

<p>Now, we're ready.</p>

<small>(Pauses as if listening to someone)</small>

<p>
  I know, I know... I will address it to Mr. God. You've nagged me a million
  times about this. I know! Just, just give me time okay. This is an important
  letter so I don't want to rush it, okay.
</p>

<small>(Starts to write)</small>

<p>Dear God, I seem to have found something that is yours.</p>
<p>A few nights ago, I was in bed, sleeping I think, and then she was there.</p>
<p>
  She was at my bedside, all white and glowing, rocking in my grannie's old
  chair.
</p>
<p>I couldn't really look at her though.</p>
<p>
  She was all bright like the sun, giving me those spots on my eyes, those ones
  you have to blink away until their gone.
</p>
<p>I must say I was a bit scared and threw the covers over my head.</p>
<p>When I looked again, she was still there! I couldn't believe it.</p>
<p>I said, "You're hurting my eyes." Kind of a silly thing to say.</p>
<p>
  Why didn't I say, "Are you a ghost?" or something a bit smarter? She said she
  was sorry and vanished.
</p>
<p>
  I was worried I'd licked a few too many pencils and was going to cut off my
  ear, but then I heard her voice.
</p>
<p>She told me how she had fallen and couldn't get back home.</p>
<p>Her wings were broken and she couldn't fly.</p>
<p>
  "Are you an angel?" I asked her. She said she was. I told her she could stay.
</p>
<p>See, I don't have many people here, just Mom.</p>
<p>
  I thought she could hang out with me. She said yes, but now Mom wants her to
  go away.
</p>
<p>
  She said it's not good for me to be talking to her. I thought mom liked angels
  but I guess not.
</p>
<p>
  Anyway... can you send a car around or a winged chariot or something to pick
  her up?
</p>
<p>She wants to come home now.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Billy Graham.</p>

<small>(Giggles)</small>

<p>
  I wonder if God will know which Billy Graham is writing him? I bet it will get
  his attention, that's for sure.
</p>

<small>(Looks at letter)</small>

<p>
  Now how do I send this? Does God have a P.O. box? Is it like Santa Clause...
  you know, Santa, North Pole... God, Heaven...
</p>

<small>(Listens to voice)</small>

<p>What? Burn the letter? Why? Will that work? If you say so.</p>

<small>(Goes to a cabinet)</small>

<p>Mom hides the matches from me. They're over here.</p>

<small>(Pulls out box of matches)</small>

<p>I think there's a reason she does.</p>

<small>(Gets out an ashtray)</small>

<p>
  I got this from Motel 6. Nice huh? I collect these things. Every time Grampa
  used to take me somewhere, I'd get one. No, they're free. They have all kinds
  of free stuff in motel rooms: pens, notepads, and towels. Grampa liked it all.
  He said he always wanted to get his money's worth.

<h3>Forget About Me</h3>

<small>MOIRA</small>

<p>
  I suffer every day and you don't even see it. You don't see the hurt inside me
  do you? But it's too much to hold inside anymore.
</p>

<p>
  I can't handle it... I'm going crazy. The fear is crippling me... I have to
  drag myself out of bed and force myself to live each day... Sure, I put on
  this happy face... I bet you think I am pretty cheerful... No one cares to see
  the pain under my skin... The pain that's ripping at me... And tearing me
  apart.
</p>

<p>What's wrong with me? You sure you want to know?</p>
<p>I feel like I am never good enough for you.</p>

<small> (Anger builds) </small>

<p>
  No matter what I do it's not as good as my sister. I always have to hear how
  she would have done it better. Or how she already did it better.
</p>
<small> (Hurt) </small>

<p>
  Why does she want to ruin my life? She just wants to blot me out like I was
  some sort of mistake... I'm just a copy... A copy of a copy... Not as good as
  the original... Not as good as you.
</p>

<small> (Sarcastic and bitter) </small>

<p>
  You are so perfect... Everyone around me is so perfect... And there was
  nothing left over for me... I am the leftover failures... I am the fatty waste
  you toss to the dogs.
</p>

<small> (Fury) </small>

<p>Everyone hates me! Why does everyone think I am so horrible...</p>

<small> (Shakes and tries to hold back the fury) </small>

<p>
  Probably because I am. A horrible creature doomed to walk this earth and
  suffer... For you.
</p>

<small> (Cries uncontrollably... Struggles to speak) </small>

<p>
  I'm hurting... Hurting so bad inside. Cut off from everyone ... Punished for
  some past life wrongs... What did I do in a past life to deserve this?.. Or am
  I paying for the sins of my father... And mother... Am I your sin? Or do I
  remind you of some sin you want to forget?
</p>

<small> (Anger builds) </small>

<p>
  Or I am a disappointment that keeps disappointing... I even disappoint myself.
</p>

<small> (Furious) </small>

<p>
  I will never be my sister. I don't want to be her. I hate everything about
  her!
</p>

<small> (Cries... Sadness) </small>

<p>
  But I don't want to be me either. Sometimes I want to fade away... Become a
  shadow... Fading away... Forgotten... Maybe if you forget about me I won't
  make you so sad anymore.
</p>
