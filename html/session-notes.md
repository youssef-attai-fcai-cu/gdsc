## Notes

- A web browser is application software for accessing websites. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays the page on the user's screen.

- A browser simply ignores any tag it doesn't understand or that was incorrectly specified. Depending on the tag and the browser, this can have varied results. Either the browser will display nothing at all, or it may display the contents of the tag as though it were normal text.

- Deprecation is the process of taking older code and marking it as no longer being useful within the codebase, usually because it has been superseded by newer code. The deprecated code is not immediately removed from the codebase because doing so may cause regression errors.

- The `<big>` tag is deprecated

- Boilerplate code are sections of code that are repeated in multiple places with little to no variation. When using languages that are considered verbose, the programmer must write a lot of boilerplate code to accomplish only minor functionality.

- All HTML documents must start with a `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration. The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.

- meta tags are HTML tags used to provide additional information about a page to search engines and other clients.
